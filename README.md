# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Facebook-Prophet-Library

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that predicts Tesla's stock prices using Facebook Prophet. The project follows a step-by-step approach to time series forecasting, including data visualization, model training, and performance evaluation.


# Dataset
The original dataset was downloaded from Yahoo Finance and contains Tesla's stock prices from 2010-06-29 to 2022-03-24.
Additionally, the forecast dataset was generated using the Prophet tool, containing trend predictions and confidence intervals. Google Sheets was used to analyze and cross-check the evaluation done by the Prophet tool.


# Project Workflow
1. Data Import & Exploration
   -> Loading Tesla stock price data using Pandas.
   -> Exploring and preprocessing the dataset.
   
2. Data Visualization
   -> Utilizing Plotly Express to visualize Tesla's historical stock performance.

3. Prophet Model Implementation
   -> Installing and importing Facebook Prophet.
   -> Training the model using historical Tesla stock price data.
   -> Forecasting future stock prices.

4. Forecast Evaluation & Cross-Checking
   -> Analyzing the forecast dataset generated by Prophet.
   -> Cross-checking evaluation results using Google Sheets.

5. Forecast Visualization
   -> Plotting predicted values alongside actual stock prices.
   -> Analyzing trends and confidence intervals.
